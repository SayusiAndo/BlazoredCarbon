# BlazoredCarbon
IBM has an open source UI system called [Carbon Design System](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com). 
This repo does its best to provide Blazor components for Carbon Components.

## Why?
This is a logical question since we have Bootstrap and other nice design systems.

I work for IBM and one of the teams I work with maintains and develop Carbon 
and an internal widget library built on Carbon. I can be a better manager if I 
work with those tools the team uses, so I understand their position better.

The second part of the answer is that, this a really good way to understand better 
[Blazor](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor). I can learn 
a lot of new things and not to mention user interface related way of thinking.

The third part of the answer is that, I have my own 
[project](https://github.com/SayusiAndo/DigitalLibrary) where a nice UI is 
needed.

It is a win-win situation.
